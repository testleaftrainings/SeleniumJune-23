Today's Agenda:
  2:30 - 3:00 -> Cucumber Introduction
  3:00 - 3:30 -> How to create feature file
  3:30 - 4:00 -> Breakout
  4:00 - 4:45 -> StepDefinition and Runner class
  4:45 - 5:00 -> Breakout
  5:00 - 6:00 -> Parameterization 
  6:00 - 6:30 -> How to pass multiple data 

Leaftaps application:

Feature: Login functionality of Leaftaps Application (Describes the functionaity of the application)
Scenario: Login with Positive credentials (Describes the behaviour/testcase)
Given    Launch the browser   (mark the precondition)
And      Load the url
And      Enter the username as Demosalesmanager
And      Enter the password as crmsfa
When     Click on the Login button (mark the test condition)
Then     HomePage should be displayed (represent the positive expected result)



Steps to create layers of Cucumber:
==================================
 1. features
 2. stepdefintion
 3. runner

1. create 3 packages
    - features
       - Right click on features package-> click New -> Click Other -> Expand General
       -> Click file -> Give filename as Login.feature -> Finish
    - steps
        - Create a new class called StepDefinition
        - Inside StepDefinition class create methods for each step for the Scenario 
        - Inside each method have real implementation / real codes
        - Link eachmethod in the StepDefinition and feature file using Cucumber annotation
            ex: @Given("Open the Chrome browser")
               public void openBrowser() {
		           driver = new ChromeDriver();
	             }
    - runner
         - Inside runner package create CucumberRunner class
         - The runner class should extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
         - On the top of the runner class use @CucumberOptions() and within that you can use attributes
            a) features -> Mention the path of the feature file
            b) glue -> Mention the package name of StepDefintion
            c) monochrome -> to remove the unreadable characters/junk files from the console
            d) publish -> to get the cucumber report in the console

Exception:
   UndefinedStepException:
      - If a step from the feature file is not defined/implemented in the StepDefinition
   DuplicateStepDefinitionException:
      - If a step in the feature file is implemented again in the Stepdefintion   

Parameterization:
  1) Identify the data in each Scenario in the feature file and surround the data with single quote
       And Enter the username as 'Demosalesmanager'
  2) In the StepDefinition replace the data with {string} Note: string should be in lowercase
        @And("Enter the username as {string}")
      	public void enterUsername() {
		
        driver.findElement(By.id("username1")).sendKeys("Demosalesmanager");
	      }
  3) Pass input arguments to the method and replace the hardcoded data with the argument
           @And("Enter the username as {string}")
	         public void enterUsername(String uName) {
		
           driver.findElement(By.id("username1")).sendKeys(uName);
	          }
            
Scenario Outline:
  1. To pass multiple data 
  2. Identify the data which has to run with multiple data and replace that data with angular brackets
        Given Enter the companyname as <companyname>
        And Enter the firstname as <firstname>
        And Enter the lastname as <lastname>                  
  3. Under Examples keyword mention the header and pass the inputs to the Scenario Outline
        Examples:
        |companyname|firstname|lastname|
        |TestLeaf|Subraja|S|
        |Qeagle|Vidhya|R|   

  4. In the StepDefintion replace the dynamic data with (.*)$  and pass input arguments to the method and
     replace the hardcoded data with the argument
         @Given("Enter the companyname as (.*)$")
	      public void enterCompanyName(String cName) {
		    driver.findElement(By.id("createLeadForm_companyName")).sendKeys(cName);
        }
