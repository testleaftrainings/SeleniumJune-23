TestNG:
      - TestNG - Cedric Beust
      - Test Next Generation
        1.Out of 20 testcases->
        Limitation:
        Run the testcases individually
        Expectation:
        Run all the testcases together as well as in parallel

        2.Reports:
          Expectation:
           A Basic Report -> Passed,Failed

        3.Failed testcases
          Expectation:
          Rerun the failed testcases automatedly 
   
        4.datas:
            Data Driven Testing

 To Run a testcase->
   -> main method
   -> testNG

How to start with TestNG:
  1. Convert main method to a normal method
       - remove static keyword from the main method
       - remove String[] args
       - Give meaningul name for the method
       - Add @Test in the top of the method

Steps to run multiple testcases:  
 1.  Select the required testcases which is marked with @Test
 2.  RightClick-> TestNG-> Click Convert to TestNG->click Finish
     At the Bottom of your project you can see the testng.xml file being created
     Note: Double click and open the testng.xml file and click Source tab at the bottom

 testng.xml:
    A suite is represented by one XML file. It can contain one or more tests and is defined by the <suite> tag.
    A test is represented by <test> and can contain one or more TestNG classes.
    <suite name ="Leaftaps Application">
      <test name = "Leaftaps Leads Module">
       <classes>
        <class name = "packagename.ClassName"/>
        <class name = "packagename.ClassName"/>   
       </classes>
      </test>

      <test name = "Leaftaps Accounts Module">
       <classes>
        <class name = "packagename.ClassName"/>
        <class name = "packagename.ClassName"/>   
       </classes>
      </test>
    </suite>


Steps to execute the testcases parallely:
  1.  Set The attribute as parallel in the xml file 
       parallel="tests" 
         - To run the test  tag parallely 
       parallel="classes"
         - To run the classes tag parallely
  2. To get the failure logs in the console set verbose as the attribute
  3. If you want to control the number of instances to be opened parallely set 
     the attribute thread-count

  To get the report:
    1. After Execution Right click and refresh your Project
    2. test-output will be generated under the project
    3. Expand it and rightclick and open index.html to view the report
    4. To view emailable-report right click on emailable-report.html and open with system editor
    5. To run the failed testcases open testng-failed.xml and execute
Annotations:

  Login is common for all the 5 testcases
